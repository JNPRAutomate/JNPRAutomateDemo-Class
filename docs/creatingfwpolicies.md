Adding VPN Firewall Policies
============================

At this point in the lab your vSRX will have access to the rest of the lab. This run will generate the necessary policies to allow us to access the host over the VPN.

Using Ansible to enable firewall policies
=========================================

For this step we will use Ansible to create both our firewall policies and the required address book objects. This is one of the most requested automation elements when dealing with a firewall. Typically once a firewall is deployed and integrated into the network there are few changes that are required on the networking side of things. However the majority of heavy lifting is centered around managing security policies and the associated address book objects. Address book objects are typically quite painful due to the need to create, manage, and have the correct association to zones. Luckily using Ansible makes these tasks a snap.

Reviewing the playbook
----------------------

First let's take a look at the playbook that is used to accomplish this task. We briefly looked at this playbook during the Ansible overview section, but now we will dive deeper into the applied steps.

**Playbook Review**

1.	Define the name of the playbook - Configure basic firewall policies
	-	This will be displayed and logged as you start to run the playbook
2.	Define the hosts the playbook should be applied to
	-	In this case we use the group "**mysrx**" to apply to
		-	The host list is picked up from either the default Ansible host list in "/etc/ansible/hosts"
		-	Alternatively when the playbook is run you can specify your own custom inventory
3.	Connection is defined to as local - Typically when Ansible runs it transports an execution environment over to the host and runs it
	-	Because this will not work on Junos hosts we use connection defined to local to run the execution environment
4.	Gather facts
	-	Ansible will gather local facts about the host such as interfaces and hostnames
	-	Because this isn't possible on Junos we disable this feature
5.	Vars - These are the variables that we will use to apply to our tasks
	-	They can be applied at many different locations for our run
	-	But to keep everything together we have included the variables into the playbook
	-	address_entires will be used to generate the address book entries
	-	fw_policy_info will be used to define our policies
		-	In this run we will be generating a policy for the VPN zone
6.	Tasks - These are the tasks that we will use
	-	The build phase for the playbook generates the Junos config from the templates
	-	The apply phase will apply the configuration to the device
	-	This will be run as two separate commits, but in doing so we can simplify the tasks and see which step fails

**Playbook**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure VPN firewall policies
  hosts: mysrx
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    junos_user: "root"
    junos_password: "Juniper"
    build_dir: "/tmp/"
    address_entries: [ {'name':'NetDevOpsVM','prefix':'172.16.0.10/32'} ]
    fw_policy_info: [ {'policy_name':'Allow_Policy','src_zone':'trust','dst_zone':'vpn','src_ips':['NetDevOpsVM'],'dst_ips':['PrivateNet'],'action':'permit','apps':['junos-http','junos-ping','junos-ssh','junos-https']}]

  tasks:
    - name: Build address book entries
      template: src=templates/fw_address_book.set.j2 dest={{build_dir}}/fw_address_book.set
      with_items: address_entries

    - name: Apply address book entries
      junos_install_config: host={{ inventory_hostname }} user={{ junos_user }} passwd={{ junos_password }} file={{ build_dir }}/fw_address_book.set overwrite=no logfile=logs/{{ inventory_hostname }}.log


    - name: Build firewall policies config template
      template: src=templates/fw_policy.set.j2 dest={{build_dir}}/fw_policy.set
      with_items: fw_policy_info

    - name: Apply firewall policies
      junos_install_config: host={{ inventory_hostname }} user={{ junos_user }} passwd={{ junos_password }} file={{ build_dir }}/fw_policy.set overwrite=no logfile=logs/{{ inventory_hostname }}.log

```

**Address book template**

-	The address book template loops through the address entries in the variable
-	It generates one "set" configuration line per loop
-	Here we are generating one

```jinja2
{% for i in address_entries %}
set security address-book global address {{ i.name }} {{ i.prefix }}
{% endfor %}
```

**Output after generation**

-	This is the generated output from the template being applied with variables
-	These commands are then committed to Junos
-	If one or more of the entries are already created it will recognize this as "OK"

```bash
set security address-book global address NetDevOpsVM 172.16.0.10/32
```

**Policy Template**

This template is a bit more complex. We need to loop through source IPs, Destination IPs, and applications. Each loop through these variables will generate a single line of "set" commands. Creating the template this way allows us to reuse it in the future when we have a larger list of addresses and applications to apply. In this example we generate multiple applications for the policy.

```jinja2
{% for item in fw_policy_info %}
    {% for i in item.src_ips %}
set security policies from-zone {{ item.src_zone }} to-zone {{ item.dst_zone }} policy {{ item.policy_name }} match source-address {{ i }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% for i in item.dst_ips %}
set security policies from-zone {{ item.src_zone }} to-zone {{ item.dst_zone }} policy {{ item.policy_name }} match destination-address {{ i }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% for i in item.apps %}
set security policies from-zone {{ item.src_zone }} to-zone {{ item.dst_zone }} policy {{ item.policy_name }} match application {{ i }}
    {% endfor %}
set security policies from-zone {{ item.src_zone }} to-zone {{ item.dst_zone }} policy {{ item.policy_name }} then {{ item.action }}
{% endfor %}

```

**Output after generation**

Once run here are the set commands that will be loaded onto the device. Again if additional elements are added they will be generated into individual set commands. While we could create the applications with a single command using a list of applications this keeps it simple to implement using individual commands.

```bash
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy match source-address NetDevOpsVM
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy match destination-address PrivateNet
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy match application junos-http
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy match application junos-ping
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy match application junos-ssh
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy match application junos-https
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn policy Allow_Policy then permit
```

Running the playbook
====================

To run the playbook you must use the "ansible-playbook" command. We must specify the inventory file and the playbook to apply. The templates will be automatically loaded from the playbook. Since [cowsay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) is installed it will also add the comical cow for our enjoyment. If you dislike our bovine friend then you can simply remove cowsay from your running host.

**Playbook Command**

Ensure before running the command you are in the "**ansible**" directory.

```bash
vagrant@NetDevOps-Student:~/JNPRAutomateDemo-Class/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/basic_firewall_policies.yml
```

**Playbook Run Example**

Once run the output should look like the following

```bash
vagrant@NetDevOps-Student:~/JNPRAutomateDemo-Class/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/vpn_firewall_policies.yml

**Validating the playbook run**

Now connect to your vSRX instance from your NetDevOpsVM and validate the change

```bash
vagrant@NetDevOps-Student:~/JNPRAutomateDemo-Class/ansible$ ssh root@172.16.0.1
Password:
--- JUNOS 12.1X47-D20.7 built 2015-03-03 21:53:50 UTC

    address NetDevOpsVM 172.16.0.10/32;
}

root@NetDevOps-SRX01> show configuration security policies from-zone trust to-zone vpn

        application [ junos-http junos-ping junos-ssh junos-https ];
    }
    then {
        permit;
    }
}
