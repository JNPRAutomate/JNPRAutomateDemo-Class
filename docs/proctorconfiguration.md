Configuring the Proctor Lab
===========================

Everything that is needed to run the proctor lab is contained within this repository.

Proctor VMs
-----------

The proctor VMs are all run via Vagrant with VirtualBox. The vagrant file is located in the proctor directory at the root of the repository.

There are three virtual machines contained within the proctor vagrant file. Please review the [topology](https://github.com/JNPRAutomate/JNPRAutomateDemo-Class/blob/master/docs/topologyoverview.md) as needed. The NetDevOps public and vSRX headend use fixed IP addresses. This simplifies the configuration within various modules of the lab. It is suggested to run the headend on a host within 16GB of RAM and a quad-core processor. It is possible to run a student VM set and the proctor VM set on the same host. However as you bring up more and more client hosts it may tax the headend SRX.
